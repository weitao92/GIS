;
; Test of searches and the buffer pool with another large database file.
;
; Specify boundaries of coordinate space:
world	1100000W	1020000W	303000N	383000N
;
; Import a large DB file:
import	NM_All.txt
;
; Check the location and name/state indices if you dare:
debug	quad
debug	hash
;
; Try a few name/state searches:
what_is	Clines Corners	NM
what_is	11476 Water Well	NM
what_is	Trinity Site	NM
what_is	Brazos Cliffs	NM
what_is	Tierra Amarilla	NM
what_is	Truth or Consequences	NM
;
; Let's see what the buffer pool looks like now:
debug	pool
;
; Try a few location searches:
what_is_at	364201N	1063259W
;
; And let's check the pool again; at this point, you might have some records
; in a different order than I'm showing:
debug	pool
;
what_is_at	351018N	1034330W
what_is_at	354929N	1055845W
what_is_at	360337N	1075801W
;
; And a few region searches, some with modifiers:
what_is_in	364201N	1063259W	60	60
what_is_in	-c	351018N	1034330W	15	15
what_is_in	351018N	1034330W	15	15
what_is_in	354929N	1055845W	30	30
what_is_in	-l	354929N	1055845W	30	30
;
; Let's check the pool again; we should agree on the top four, although they
; could be in a different order:
debug	pool
;
; Exit
quit
