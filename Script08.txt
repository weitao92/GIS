; Script 8
;
; General test with a large dB and multiple imports.
;
; Specify boundaries of coordinate space:
world	1130000W	0990000W	300000N	440000N
;
; Import a large DB file:
import	NM_All.txt
;
; Check the location and name/state indices if you dare:
debug	quad
debug	hash
;
; Try a few name/state searches:
what_is	Clines Corners	NM
what_is	11476 Water Well	NM
what_is	Trinity Site	NM
what_is	Brazos Cliffs	NM
what_is	Tierra Amarilla	NM
what_is	Truth or Consequences	NM
;
; Let's see what the buffer pool looks like now:
debug	pool
;
; Try a few location searches:
what_is_at	364201N	1063259W
;
; And let's check the pool again; at this point, you might have some records
; in a different order than I'm showing:
debug	pool
;
what_is_at	351018N	1034330W
what_is_at	354929N	1055845W
what_is_at	360337N	1075801W
;
; And a few region searches:
what_is_in	364201N	1063259W	60	60
what_is_in	351018N	1034330W	15	15
what_is_in	354929N	1055845W	30	30
;
; Let's check the pool again; we should agree on the top four, although they
; could be in a different order:
debug	pool
;
; Now, let's import some more data:
import	CO_All.txt
;
; And have a look at the indices, if you dare:
debug	quad
debug	hash
;
; And some searches; let's see if you're taking the state abbreviation into account:
what_is	Lincoln	CO
what_is	Lincoln	NM
;
; Let's try spanning the border:
what_is_in	365800N	1043030W	720	45
;
; Let's try a larger region:
what_is_in	-c	370000N	1040000W	3600	3600
;
; And some more or less random searches:
what_is	Eagle Peak	NM
what_is	Scott Spring	NM
what_is	Slab Mill Gulch	CO
what_is	Oak Canyon	NM
what_is	Kemper School	CO
what_is_at	380806N	1073426W
what_is_at	371010N	1043002W
what_is_at	402906N	1064954W
